# ðŸ“š Some Theory

## <mark style="color:blue;">Client-Based VPN vs SSL VPN</mark>

* SSL VPN use the browser as the VPN client. So the client does not need to install any VPN client software. The connection is established between the browser and a VPN SSL gateway.
* Client-Based VPN requires a software to establish a VPN connection.

## <mark style="color:blue;">2 Categories of ports :</mark>

* TCP : Connection oriented which means thats the connection between the client and the server must be established before data can be sent.
* UDP : Connectionless&#x20;

So we can use either TCP or UDP for our ports.
